## How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?

## Read and assign RDS files
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

## Subset Maryland and On-road data from entire NEI dataset
MD2 <- subset(NEI, fips=='24510' & type=="ON-ROAD")

## Split data by year and sum Emmissions for each of those years
PM25Data <- tapply(MD2$Emissions, MD2$year, sum)

## Plot and save barplot to illustrate trend in Emissions from 1999 t0 2008 for Maryland from motor vehicles
